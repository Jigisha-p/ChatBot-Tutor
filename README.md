# ChatGPT API:
The release of the chatGPT API allows for a new interface to utilize the language models specifically designed for dialogue.

The API call can take a series of messages for context, allowing for a conversation between the "user" (the human using the system) and the "assistant" (the response from the model)

These key differences in the context of dialogue are all passed into a parameter called "messages", that accepts a list of dictionaries that define the system role and then a dialogue conversation.
